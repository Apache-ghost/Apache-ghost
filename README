Hi there! I'm Guegouo M. Guiddel, a passionate software engineering student with a strong interest in using my skills and knowledge to solve problems and build solutions. I'm currently taking my bachelor's degree in computer software engineering at ICT University, and I have a broad range of interests that span from software engineering, AI, Robotics to Hardware technologies.

In my free time, I love to engage in competitive programming and problem solving challenges. I believe that these activities not only help me to improve my skills and knowledge, but they also allow me to have fun while doing something I'm passionate about.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm open to exploring any opportunities that may come my way.
